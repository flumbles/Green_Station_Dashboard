# Green Station Sustainability Dashboard 
## A dashboard created to study energy savings in Train Stations

I developed an interactive sustainability evaluation dashboard focused on analyzing energy-saving initiatives for train stations. The dashboard features a dynamic interface with:

A collapsible sidebar containing key input parameters:
  
  - Monthly air-conditioning energy costs per station ($)
  - Number of stations
  - One-time capital expenditure (CAPEX)
  - Annual operating expenses (OPEX)
  - Electricity tariff rates ($/kWh)
  - Reference consumption metrics:
    - Average 4-room flat energy usage (kWh)
    - Tree equivalent energy impact (kWh)

The main dashboard displays calculated outcomes including:

- Annual monetary savings
- Annual energy savings in kWh
- ROI projection over 15 years
- Project payback period
- Environmental impact equivalents:
  - Number of 4-room flats' worth of energy saved
  - Equivalent number of trees in CO2 reduction
- Interactive graphs showing relationships between:
  - ROI vs Percentage Savings
  - Payback Period vs Percentage Savings
  - Annual Savings vs Percentage Savings



This tool enables quick evaluation of sustainability business cases by visualizing both financial returns and environmental impact metrics in an accessible format.
